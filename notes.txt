													🙏 Namaste React 🙏
														
		## Introduction/Inception : 
			
					-- Browser does know about js but not about the react.
					-- we can import react in our project by -- 1. CDN  2. Physical file
					
			>> CDN : A content delivery network (CDN)
					 is a network of interconnected servers that
					 speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.
					 -- it is where react library is hoisted & we are just pulling react in our project.
					 
			>> CORS : CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing,
					   and is a mechanism that allows 
					   resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain
			
			>> Cross-Origin : 			
						The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
						A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
  
		>> CDN contains two files :
				1. React : Main core react file
				2. ReactDOM  : DOM file (Bridge between react and browser)
				
				Why two file ??
				 -- React not only works with web it works also with mobile (react native) so thats why two files.
				
				>> react needs a root element to render the stuff. we can create this root element using ReactDOM.
				>> for browser most costly thing is to DOM manipulation. React is having optimised DOM manipulation.
				
					--  const element = React.createElement(tagName,{attributes},child/value)
								-- This API method returns the js object.
								-- child :  -- we can pass another element over here also 
											-- also we can use array to make it siblings.
								
					--  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); // It assigns the root inside react 

					-- 	root.render(element);
									-- converts js object to HTML & then put it inside the root 
									-- Take this object & creates the tags which browser understands & put that inside the root element
									
								>>> ReactElement(Object) ==> HTML (Browser Understands) <<<
								
					## It is hard create element using createElement so to get rid of this we have JSX.
					## Root is just get replaced by the element which we have passed inside render.
					## React is library which can work on the small portion of web page also.
